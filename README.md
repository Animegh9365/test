This is my first project on spring boot.
It is a simple website with a form that takes random numbers and uses bubble sort technique to sort numbers.
Did the project to test myself if I could build a website without any tutorial (with an exception that I used chat-gpt to help learn the workflow of spring framework).
Learnt what annotations are. The directory structure etc. Overall it was a good experience.
